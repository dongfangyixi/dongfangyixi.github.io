## Motivition

I have always been interested in simulated neural networks and the relation between computational neural science and artificial intelligence. This paper introduce [Alpha Synaptic Function](https://fohs.bgu.ac.il/nia/nia2003/neurolab/help/alphasyn.htm) into neural networks to encode the temporal information which sounds extremely amazing.
